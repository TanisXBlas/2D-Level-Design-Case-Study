#### “Sally Face” is a 2D side scroller where the objective of the game is to solve puzzles and collect key items in order to continue and learn more about the mystery of Sally Face, our main protagonist.

#### Overall, the game has an eerie and disturbing tone to it. Starting out the game, your character feels very responsive to your actions. He doesn’t have a delay while stopping and he is never in a rush to get anywhere. Even while there’s something frightening ahead, your character always has a casual attitude around them. For example, as you’re just starting out, Sally is covered in blood as his entire head is wrapped in bandages. While this may shock the player, Sally isn’t panicking and is able to walk normally through the hospital.

###### Sally's movement is irrelevant to his injuries.

#### Since this game has a lot of puzzle solving to achieve, you often encounter situations that require certain items and interactions to continue. This is seen well in the first room you’re in. After receiving a call from your dad, you search the hospital for a way out. After moving a cabinet and finding a key, you make your way out of the room and encounter a few doors that require you to solve which order to walk through. So this game immediately puts you in a tight spot and you have to find your way through as there is danger nearby.

###### One of the first puzzles have you walk through a series of doors with letters next to them.

#### The game does a pretty good job at showing you where to go. Since your movement is limited to walking side-to-side and entering/exiting rooms, you don’t have many places to get lost in. There are quite a few indications that say you can press a button and interact with some object. For example, the cabinet in the first room makes text appear by your character and say that there is a cabinet, and pressing the “use” key allows you to interact with the cabinet and push it away. After that, you encounter a similar situation with the door that displays “door” and allows you to use an item on it.

###### Indication that the cabinet can be moved.

#### To add on top of guiding the player directly, there is another instance of the player receiving some assistance, but this is much more discrete. The camera that views your character does not always have them in the middle of the screen. If you are by a wall, or as your exit the room, the camera will stop following the character until the character hits either the wall or near the edge of the screen. This is to indicate that the player cannot go that way and must turn back.

###### The game's discrete way of showing you to go the other way via the camera's view.

#### To finish off, the pacing of the game and puzzles get progressively harder as time moves on. The first few puzzles are relatively easy to solve with basic items that aren’t too confusing to the player. As you meet new characters and explore different areas, you are given new mysteries to solve and new obstacles to overcome.

###### The game's puzzles start out simple, requiring only a key and one puzzle to solve to continue with the story.
